        <strong>Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier</strong> (/ˈfʊrieɪ, -iər/;[1] French: [fuʁje]; 21 March 1768 – 16 May 1830)
        was a French
        mathematician and physicist born in Auxerre and <em>best known for initiating the investigation of Fourier
          series</em>,
        which
        eventually developed into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_analysis">Fourier analysis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_analysis">harmonic analysis</a>, and their
        applications to problems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_transfer">heat
          transfer</a>
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration">vibrations</a>.

      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>Fourier was born at Auxerre (now in the Yonne département of France), the son of a tailor. He was orphaned at
        the age of
        nine. Fourier was recommended to the Bishop of Auxerre and, through this introduction, he was educated by the
        Benedictine Order of the Convent of St. Mark. The commissions in the scientific corps of the army were reserved
        for
        those of good birth, and being thus ineligible, he accepted a military lectureship on mathematics. He took a
        prominent
        part in his own district in promoting the French Revolution, serving on the local Revolutionary Committee. He
        was
        imprisoned briefly during the Terror but, in 1795, was appointed to the École Normale and subsequently succeeded
        Joseph-Louis Lagrange at the École Polytechnique.</p>

          Joseph Fourier made important contributions to the study of trigonometric series, after preliminary
          investigations by
          Leonhard
          Euler, Jean le Rond d'Alembert, and Daniel Bernoulli. Through Fourier's research the fact was established that
          an
          arbitrary (at first, continuous[6] and later generalized to
          any piecewise-smooth[7]) function can be represented by a trigonometric series.
